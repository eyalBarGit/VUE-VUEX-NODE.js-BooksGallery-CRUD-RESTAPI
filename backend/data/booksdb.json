    "description": "This book investigates the well-posedness of the mathematical model behind the method \"Image Inpainting Based on Coherence Transport\". Image inpainting methods serve the purpose of touching up damaged or unwanted elements of a digital picture. The model behind the mentioned method is a Dirichlet problem for a first order quasi-linear hyperbolic functional partial differential equation where all points of the boundary are inflow points. The main concern of this thesis is to proof the existence and the uniqueness of a solution to such kind of problems as well as the solutions's continuous dependence on the data. The general theory finally is used to obtain the well-posedness of the inpainting model.",

Contemporary discourse and hermeneutical discussions have led to the development of a point of confusion in theological hermeneutics, focusing on what relationship older frames of reference may have with those more recent. Bernhard Duhm is presented as a history-of-Religion scholar who does not easily abide by popular understandings of that school. Brevard Childs moves outward from particular historical judgments regarding the nature of redaction and form criticism, attempting to arrive at a proximately theological reading of the poem. Alec Motyer's evangelical commitments represent a large constituency of contemporary theological readership, and a popular understanding of Isaiah 53. Following a summary and critical engagement of each interpreter on his own terms, the study analyzes the use of rhetoric behind the respective readings of Isaiah 53, and proposes theological reading as a highly eclectic undertaking, distanced from the demarcations of 'pre-critical', 'critical', and 'post-critical'.",

    "description": "Written by key experts in the field of nanomedicine, this book provides a broad introduction to the important field of nanomedicine and application of nanotechnology for drug delivery. It covers up-to-date information regarding various nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, describes the various opportunities for the application of nanoparticular drug carriers in different areas of clinical medicine, and analyzes already available information on their clinical applications. This book can be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students and young scientists and clinicians at the early stages of their career. It is also suitable for non-experts from related areas of chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, biomedical engineering, physiology, experimental and clinical medicine, and pharmaceutical sciences, who are interested in general problems of drug delivery and drug targeting, as well as in more specialized topics of using nanoparticulate-mediated drug delivery approaches in the individual areas of clinical medicine. Prof Torchilin is an expert in Nanomedicine and a recipient of numerous awards including the Lenin Prize in Science & Technology of the former USSR, membership in the European Academy of Sciences, and AAPS Research Achievement Award in Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery. He served as an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School before joining Northeastern University as the Chairman of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Sample Chapter(s). Chapter 1: Introduction. Nanocarriers for Drug Delivery: Needs and Requirements (442 KB). Contents: Nanoparticle Flow: Implications for Drug Delivery (A T Florence); Polymer Micelles as Drug Carriers (E V Batrakova et al.); Lipoproteins as Pharmaceutical Carriers (S Liu et al.); Dendrimers as Nanoparticular Drug Carriers (S Svenson & D A Tomalia); Cells and Cell Ghosts as Drug Carriers (J M Lanao & M L Sayalero); Magnetic Nanoparticles as Drug Carriers (U O Hnfeli & M Chastellain); Liposomal Drug Carriers in Cancer Therapy (A A Gabizon); Delivery of Nanoparticles to the Cardiovascular System (B-A Khaw); Nanoparticles for Targeting Lymphatics (W Phillips); Nanoparticular Carriers for Ocular Drug Delivery (A Sanchez & M J Alonso); and other papers.
